git-curse
=========

A Twitter bot built with Python that posts GitHub commits containing profanity. Follow it @GitCurse on Twitter!

The bot only needs Python 3 standard library modules to work.

To use this bot yourself, you'll have to generate keys for both GitHub and Twitter's APIs. Place those keys in keys.json and then run.

Using the -d flag on gitcurse.py will cause the script to write errors and successful tweet posts to a log file.
